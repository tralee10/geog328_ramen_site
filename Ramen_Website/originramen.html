<!-- Content for Origin of Ramen -->
    <div class="content">
        Ramen's origins can be traced back to the early 20th century when Chinese immigrants introduced wheat-based noodles to Japan. These noodles, known as shina soba (literally "Chinese soba"), were initially sold by street vendors in port cities like Yokohama and Kobe. The dish gained popularity among Japanese workers due to its affordability, hearty broth, and satisfying texture.
    <p>As ramen spread across Japan, it evolved to incorporate local flavors and ingredients, giving rise to the diverse regional variations we see today. For example, Sapporo ramen in Hokkaido is known for its rich miso broth and butter toppings, while Hakata ramen from Fukuoka features a creamy tonkotsu (pork bone) broth with thin, firm noodles. In Tokyo, shoyu (soy sauce-based) ramen remains the most popular, characterized by a clear, savory broth and curly noodles.</p>
    <p>During the post-World War II era, ramen became even more accessible with the rise of instant ramen, invented by Momofuku Ando in 1958. His innovation revolutionized the dish, making it a global phenomenon. Today, ramen continues to evolve, with chefs experimenting with new broths, toppings, and even fusion influences, ensuring its place as one of Japanâ€™s most iconic and beloved foods.</p>
